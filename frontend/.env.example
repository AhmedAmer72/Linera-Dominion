# ===================================
# Copy this file to .env.local and configure for your environment

# ====================

# ====================
# REQUIRED: APPLICATION ID
# ====================
# The Application ID from your `linera publish-and-create` deployment
# This is the only required configuration for the deployed app

# FAUCET CONFIGURATION
# ====================
# The faucet is used for:
# - Creating wallets
# - Claiming microchains for users
